# ASR 1004: Graceful Network Error Handling

Status: Proposed
Date: 2025-09-18

## Context
Network access can be unavailable or intermittent, especially in sandboxed environments. The server should degrade gracefully without crashing.

## Requirement
- Catch and surface network-related exceptions (timeouts, connection errors, APIError) as concise, user-readable messages.
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging without leaking sensitive data.
- Never crash the server due to remote API failures; return a structured error response instead.

## Implications
- Centralize error mapping and ensure consistent messaging across tools.
- Unit tests should simulate common failure modes and assert stable messages.

## Alternatives considered
- Propagate raw exceptions: rejected for poor UX and instability.

## Addendums
- 2025-09-18: Proposed alongside ADR 0007.
