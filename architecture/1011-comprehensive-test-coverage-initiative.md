# ASR 1011: Comprehensive Test Coverage Initiative

Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-01-10

## Context

As the STAC MCP Server codebase has grown with new features (ADR 0003-0009, ASR 1001-1010), maintaining high code quality and confidence in changes has become critical. While the existing test suite provides good baseline coverage, systematic gaps exist in:

1. **Edge case testing**: Many tools and handlers lack tests for boundary conditions, empty results, malformed inputs, and error scenarios
2. **Branch coverage**: Conditional logic in observability, client retry mechanisms, and error handling lacks comprehensive testing
3. **Integration scenarios**: Limited tests for multi-tool workflows and component interactions
4. **Coverage visibility**: No enforced minimum coverage thresholds in CI to prevent regressions

These gaps increase the risk of undetected bugs, make refactoring more dangerous, and reduce team confidence when making changes.

## Requirement

Systematically increase test coverage to meet the following measurable targets:

### Coverage Targets
- **Overall Project**: ≥ 85% statement coverage, ≥ 80% branch coverage (enforced in CI)
- **Core Modules** (server.py, client.py, execution.py): ≥ 95% statement, ≥ 90% branch
- **Tool Handlers**: ≥ 90% statement, ≥ 80% branch
- **Observability**: ≥ 90% statement, ≥ 85% branch

### Test Categories Required
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
   - Edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, maximum limits)
   - Error conditions (network failures, timeouts, malformed data)
   - Type variations (different input types, None values)

2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
   - Tool handler → client → external API flows
   - Observability instrumentation across tool calls
   - Retry logic with simulated failures

3. **Branch Coverage Tests**: Exercise all conditional paths
   - Environment variable configurations
   - Optional parameter combinations
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Error recovery paths

### CI/CD Requirements
- Automated coverage reporting on every PR and main branch push
- Coverage threshold enforcement (fail build if < 85%)
- Coverage badge generation and automatic updates
- HTML coverage reports as build artifacts

### Documentation Requirements
- Test coverage strategy document
- Testing patterns and best practices guide
- Coverage monitoring and maintenance procedures
- Clear guidelines for new contributors

## Decision

Implement comprehensive test coverage improvements across the following phases:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Documentation (Completed)
✅ Create test coverage strategy document (`docs/TEST_COVERAGE_STRATEGY.md`)
✅ Add coverage threshold enforcement to CI workflow (≥85%)
✅ Document testing patterns, best practices, and maintenance procedures

### Phase 2: Core Test Additions (Completed)
✅ **Tool Handler Edge Cases** (`tests/test_tool_handlers_edge_cases.py`)
   - 50+ tests covering all tool handlers (get_root, get_conformance, etc.)
   - Edge cases: empty results, minimal data, many items (>limit)
   - Output format variations (text/JSON)
   - Error conditions and malformed inputs

✅ **Tool Definitions Comprehensive** (`tests/test_definitions_comprehensive.py`)
   - 40+ tests validating tool definition structure
   - JSON Schema validation for all input schemas
   - Parameter consistency checks across tools
   - Transaction tool validation

✅ **Observability Branch Coverage** (`tests/test_observability_branches.py`)
   - 45+ tests for conditional branches
   - Environment variable handling (all permutations)
   - Metrics registry thread-safety
   - Log format variations (text/JSON)
   - Trace span enabled/disabled scenarios

✅ **Execution Module Comprehensive** (`tests/test_execution_comprehensive.py`)
   - 35+ tests for tool execution logic
   - Return type handling (dict, list, string, None)
   - Error propagation and logging
   - Performance edge cases (large results, deep nesting)

✅ **Client Edge Cases** (`tests/test_client_edge_cases.py`)
   - 40+ tests for HTTP client scenarios
   - URL construction and encoding
   - Header manipulation
   - Retry logic boundary conditions
   - Response parsing edge cases

**Total New Tests**: ~250+ test cases across 5 new test files

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Maintenance (Ongoing)
- Weekly CI coverage trend review
- Quarterly coverage target reassessment
- Test performance monitoring (keep < 2 minutes total)
- Documentation updates as patterns evolve

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Reduced Regression Risk**: Comprehensive tests catch bugs before they reach production
2. **Refactoring Confidence**: High coverage enables safe code restructuring
3. **Better Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of expected behavior
4. **Quality Gate**: CI threshold prevents coverage regressions
5. **Onboarding Aid**: New contributors can understand behavior through tests

### Negative
1. **Initial Time Investment**: Creating 250+ tests requires significant upfront effort
2. **Maintenance Burden**: More tests to maintain when APIs change
3. **CI Time**: Longer test execution (though still < 2 minutes target)
4. **False Security**: High coverage doesn't guarantee correctness, just that code is exercised

### Mitigation Strategies
- **For Maintenance**: Follow documented testing patterns to keep tests consistent and DRY
- **For CI Time**: Run tests in parallel where possible, optimize slow tests
- **For False Security**: Combine coverage with integration tests, manual QA, and production monitoring
- **For Time Investment**: Tests written now prevent 10x time spent debugging later

## Implementation Details

### Test File Organization
```
tests/
├── test_tool_handlers_edge_cases.py       # Tool handler edge cases
├── test_definitions_comprehensive.py      # Tool definition validation
├── test_observability_branches.py         # Observability branch coverage
├── test_execution_comprehensive.py        # Execution module tests
├── test_client_edge_cases.py             # Client edge cases
└── [existing test files...]              # 10+ existing test files
```

### Coverage Configuration
`.coveragerc`:
```ini
[run]
source = stac_mcp
omit = tests/*, scripts/version.py
branch = True

[report]
show_missing = True
skip_empty = True
precision = 1
exclude_lines =
    pragma: no cover
    if __name__ == .__main__.:
    pass
```

### CI Workflow Enhancement
```yaml
- name: Tests + coverage
  run: |
    uv run coverage run -m pytest -q
    uv run coverage xml
    uv run python scripts/generate_coverage_badge.py coverage.xml coverage-badge.svg
    uv run coverage report

- name: Check coverage threshold
  run: |
    uv run coverage report --fail-under=85
```

### Test Patterns Used
1. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
2. **Parametrized Tests**: Reduce duplication for similar cases
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Prevent network calls, ensure deterministic behavior
4. **Descriptive Test Names**: `test_<function>_<scenario>_<expected_behavior>`
5. **Docstrings**: Explain test purpose and edge case being verified

## Metrics & Success Criteria

### Before This Initiative
- Total test files: 15
- Estimated coverage: ~70-80% (varies by module)
- No CI coverage threshold
- Limited edge case coverage

### After Phase 2 (Current)
- Total test files: 20 (+5 comprehensive test files)
- Total test cases: ~300+ tests
- CI coverage threshold: 85% statement coverage
- Comprehensive edge case coverage for:
  - All tool handlers
  - Tool definitions
  - Observability layer
  - Execution module
  - HTTP client

### Ongoing Success Metrics
- Coverage stays ≥ 85% (enforced by CI)
- Test execution time stays < 2 minutes
- Zero coverage regressions in PRs
- New code includes tests (coverage doesn't drop)

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Mutation Testing**: More rigorous than coverage, but much slower and complex
   - **Rejected**: Too expensive for current project size
   
2. **Property-Based Testing**: Hypothesis for generating test cases
   - **Deferred**: Consider for Phase 4 if needed
   
3. **Integration Tests Only**: Focus on end-to-end scenarios
   - **Rejected**: Misses edge cases in individual units
   
4. **Lower Coverage Threshold (70%)**: Less strict requirement
   - **Rejected**: 85% provides better safety net for critical infrastructure

5. **Manual Testing**: Rely on human QA
   - **Rejected**: Not scalable, not reproducible, can't run in CI
