## Sentinel-2 L2A Conformance on Microsoft Planetary Computer

Below is a focused breakdown of what “conformance” means here, how the Planetary Computer STAC API capabilities line up with the Sentinel-2 Level‑2A collection, and what you can (and can’t) rely on when building queries or tooling.

### 1. API-Level Conformance (Planetary Computer Root)

The API reports 15 conformance classes:

Supports (high‑value highlights):
- STAC Core + Collections + Item Search: 
  - https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0/core  
  - https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0/collections  
  - https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0/item-search  
- Item Search Extensions:
  - Sort: https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0/item-search#sort
  - Fields filtering (include/exclude): https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0/item-search#fields
  - Query (simple JSON-based comparisons): https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0/item-search#query
  - Filter (CQL2): https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-rc.2/item-search#filter
- OGC API Features Core & GeoJSON (interoperability):
  - http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/core
  - http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/geojson
  - OpenAPI description: http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/oas30
- CQL2 (text + JSON encodings):
  - http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/basic-cql2
  - http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/cql2-text
  - http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/cql2-json
- OGC API Features Filter extension:
  - http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-3/1.0/conf/filter
- Combined mapping:
  - https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0/ogcapi-features

Not supported (as observed):
- Queryables endpoint: A direct call failed; no advertised conformance class for queryables extension.
- Aggregations extension: Not listed (no specialized conformance URI in set returned).
- Transaction extension: Not listed (no create/update/delete advertised via conformance).

Practical takeaway: You can rely on both legacy STAC Item Search filters (bbox, datetime, collections, basic “query”) and modern CQL2 filters (advanced logical, spatial, temporal predicates) plus sort and field selection. Dedicated /queryables discovery isn’t available, so you must infer field names from documentation or sample Items.

### 2. Collection-Level Traits (Sentinel-2 L2A)

Core metadata from the collection:
- ID: sentinel-2-l2a
- Temporal coverage: 2015‑06‑27T10:25:31Z → open-ended (continually updating)
- Global spatial extent (worldwide)
- Providers: ESA (producer/licensor), Esri & Microsoft (processing/hosting)
- License: proprietary (standard for Sentinel-2 redistributed via this channel with usage terms)
- Summaries include:
  - gsd: 10, 20, 60 (used for quick resolution filtering if/when client-side)
  - eo:bands with full spectral metadata (names, common_name, center_wavelength, fwhm)
  - platform: Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B
  - instruments: msi
  - constellation: sentinel-2
  - view:off_nadir: [0] (indicates mostly nadir acquisitions)
- Assets (notably):
  - COG band assets per Item (implied, though not listed here because those appear on Items)
  - Thumbnail (PNG)
  - GeoParquet snapshot of Items (geoparquet-items) enabling bulk analytics access (non-standard STAC role 'stac-items').

Likely STAC Extensions in Items (inferred from field prefixes and domain norms, though not enumerated explicitly in the trimmed response):
- eo (Electro-Optical)
- view (for view:off_nadir)
- proj (common for geometry/projection specifics — verify in an Item)
- Possibly msft:* vendor fields and table:* for analytics enablement

Because the JSON snippet you have doesn’t explicitly show a “stac_extensions” array at the collection root, those extensions are typically declared on Items. When building filters, rely on standard STAC & EO extension field names like:
- eo:cloud_cover
- platform / instruments
- gsd (top-level or via summaries)
- datetime (core)
- id (core)

### 3. How Conformance Enables Queries

You can combine capabilities:

Basic STAC Item Search parameters:
- collections=["sentinel-2-l2a"]
- bbox=[west,south,east,north]
- datetime="2024-06-01/2024-06-30"
- limit= (pagination chunk)

Enhanced with:
- sortby=[{field:"datetime",direction:"desc"}]
- fields={"include":["id","assets.thumbnail","eo:cloud_cover","datetime"],"exclude":["assets.*"]} (example)
- query={"eo:cloud_cover":{"lt":20}} (legacy query syntax)
- OR (prefer) CQL2 filter:
  filter= "eo:cloud_cover < 20 AND datetime BETWEEN 2024-06-01T00:00:00Z AND 2024-06-30T23:59:59Z"

Spatial example in CQL2:
  filter = "INTERSECTS(geometry, POLYGON((...))) AND platform = 'Sentinel-2B'"

Because queryables endpoint is absent, validation of property names happens server-side at execution—typos may return errors rather than early discovery.

### 4. What You Cannot Do (Per Current Conformance Set)

- No STAC Transactions: You cannot POST new Items/Collections or PATCH/DELETE via the public API (read-only dataset).
- No advertised Queryables discovery: Must infer properties; cannot programmatically fetch query schema.
- No native Aggregations (e.g., histogram or stats) via a STAC API aggregation extension; you’d need to:
  1. Page through results client-side and aggregate, or
  2. Use the GeoParquet export in an external analytics engine (Spark, DuckDB, Dask, etc.).
- No explicit Fields for dynamic property-introspection (beyond examples or docs).

### 5. Practical Strategy Recommendations

1. Prefer CQL2 filters for complex attribute + spatial + temporal logic (future-proof, expressive).
2. Use Fields extension to reduce payload size (especially when iterating over large time spans).
3. For large-scale analytics, download or access the GeoParquet snapshot (partitioned weekly) and run columnar queries locally or in cloud compute—this bypasses API pagination bottlenecks.
4. Cache band metadata (eo:bands array) locally since it’s static and reuse for downstream spectral processing logic.
5. Always handle pagination (next links) and implement retry/backoff for network resilience.

### 6. Quick Capability Matrix

Capability | Supported | Notes
-----------|-----------|------
Core STAC (Collections, Items) | Yes | Standard endpoints
Search (bbox, datetime, collections) | Yes | Baseline
Sort | Yes | sort extension
Fields (include/exclude) | Yes | Optimize bandwidth
Query (legacy JSON) | Yes | Simpler comparisons
CQL2 (text & JSON) | Yes | Advanced filters
Filter extension (OGC API Features Filter) | Yes | Underpins CQL2 semantics
Queryables | No | Call failed; not advertised
Transactions | No | Read-only dataset
Aggregations | Not advertised | Use external processing
OpenAPI spec | Yes | For client generation
GeoParquet bulk export | Yes (asset) | Non-standard but very useful

### 7. Summary

The Sentinel-2 L2A collection on Planetary Computer sits atop a robust STAC + OGC API Features implementation supporting advanced filtering (CQL2), sorting, and field selection—sufficient for fine-grained discovery and efficient data extraction. Lacking queryables and transactions means schema introspection and write operations are off the table, and absence of aggregation endpoints shifts analytic workloads to client-side or the provided GeoParquet export.

If you’d like, I can:
- Craft example CQL2 queries for specific scenarios
- Show how to down-select only necessary bands/assets
- Provide a sample workflow using the GeoParquet export

Just let me know what you want next.

Not present (relative to Planetary Computer):
- No CQL2 conformance classes (no basic-cql2 / cql2-text / cql2-json)
- No explicit OGC API Filter conformance
- No queryables support (calls failed globally and per-collection)
- No transactions (no create/update/delete class)
  
Present on Planetary Computer but absent here:
- CQL2 (3 URIs)
- OGC API Features Filter extension
- (PC did not list aggregations; AWS lists a legacy aggregation draft instead)

### 2. Collection Metadata: `sentinel-2-l2a` (AWS)

Key fields from AWS collection:
- ID: sentinel-2-l2a
- Temporal extent: starts 2015-06-27T10:25:31.456000Z → open
- Spatial extent: global
- Providers: ESA (producer), Sinergise (processor), AWS (host), Element 84 (processor)
- Summaries:
  - platform: sentinel-2a, sentinel-2b (lowercase vs mixed case on PC)
  - instruments: msi
  - constellation: sentinel-2
  - gsd: 10, 20, 60
  - view:off_nadir: [0]
  - sci:doi: 10.5270/s2_-znk9xsj (explicit DOI surfaced here; PC snippet didn’t show DOI)
  - eo:bands: Similar set but using semantic names (coastal, blue, green, red, rededge1..3, nir, nir08, nir09, cirrus, swir16, swir22) rather than raw band identifiers B01/B02 etc.
    - Notably includes cirrus (band 10) which PC L2A list replaced with AOT/B09 naming differences (PC example had separate AOT and water vapor names; AWS uses cirrus/nir09 pattern)
- Assets object empty in the collection document (band assets appear per Item in searches)

Differences vs Planetary Computer collection snapshot:
- Band naming style: AWS uses descriptive/common names; PC uses standard S2 band codes (B01, B02...) plus auxiliary bands (AOT, B09 etc.).
- DOI provided on AWS; PC snippet omitted (may be present in full PC collection).
- Summaries on PC included both numeric band IDs and common_name; AWS leans on common_name-based naming (makes semantic filtering simpler if properties align).
- PC includes a GeoParquet STAC Items export asset (analytics convenience); AWS collection JSON did not show a similar bulk export asset.

### 3. Functional Capability Impact

Capability | AWS Earth Search | Planetary Computer
-----------|------------------|-------------------
Basic STAC Search (bbox, datetime, collections) | Yes | Yes
Sort | Yes | Yes
Fields include/exclude | Yes | Yes
Legacy query (JSON query extension) | Yes | Yes
Aggregation (legacy draft) | Yes (v0.3.0/aggregation) | Not advertised
CQL2 (advanced filter language) | No | Yes
OGC API Filter (CQL2 binding) | No | Yes
Queryables endpoint | No | No
Transactions | No | No

Implications:
- Complex boolean/logical/spatial attribute expressions must be composed using the older “query” extension on AWS; you cannot rely on CQL2 syntax there.
- On AWS you may experiment with the legacy aggregations extension for counts/stats (subject to draft semantics); on PC you’d implement client-side or use the GeoParquet export.
- Cross-platform client code should feature capability probing:
  1. Prefer CQL2 if advertised (PC).
  2. Else fall back to legacy `query` object (AWS + PC).
  3. Attempt aggregations only if the aggregation conformance URI is present (AWS).
  4. Skip queryables discovery and rely on schema heuristics for both.

### 4. Practical Query Strategies (AWS)

Examples (pseudocode parameter sets):

Simple date + cloud cover (legacy query):
```
collections = ["sentinel-2-l2a"]
datetime = "2024-06-01/2024-06-30"
query = { "eo:cloud_cover": { "lt": 20 } }
limit = 50
```

Restrict properties to shrink payload:
```
fields = {
  "include": ["id", "datetime", "assets.thumbnail", "eo:cloud_cover"],
  "exclude": ["assets.*"]
}
```

Approximate “multi-condition” logic (no CQL2):
- Combine multiple property constraints inside `query` (implicit AND):
```
query = {
  "eo:cloud_cover": {"lt": 15},
  "platform": {"in": ["sentinel-2a","sentinel-2b"]},
  "view:off_nadir": {"eq": 0}
}
```

Aggregation (if implemented per spec draft):
- You’d POST search with an `aggregations` object (exact shape depends on server’s draft support—must test; treat failures gracefully).

### 5. Interoperability Notes

Field name normalization:
- Platform values differ in case (PC: Sentinel-2A/B vs AWS: sentinel-2a/b). For portable filters normalize to lowercase before constructing equality tests when possible, or maintain a mapping.

Band referencing:
- If your workflow addresses assets by band name, consider building a translation map:
  - PC “B02” ↔ AWS “blue”
  - PC “B08” ↔ AWS “nir”
  - PC “B8A” ↔ AWS “nir08”
  - PC “B09” (water vapor) ↔ AWS “nir09”
  - PC “B10” (cirrus) ↔ AWS “cirrus”
  - PC “B11” ↔ AWS “swir16”
  - PC “B12” ↔ AWS “swir22”
  - PC “B01” ↔ AWS “coastal”
  - Red edge bands map (B05,B06,B07) ↔ rededge1, rededge2, rededge3

Cloud cover semantics:
- `eo:cloud_cover` property is consistent conceptually; confirm numeric range (0–100) across both (standard for Sentinel-2 STAC Items).

### 6. Comparative Summary

High-Level:
- Planetary Computer: Modern filtering (CQL2), no aggregation extension, enhanced analytics asset (GeoParquet).
- AWS Earth Search: Legacy + profile-based extensions (includes aggregation draft), no modern CQL2 filter classes.

Design Guidance for a Dual-Backend Client:
1. Fetch conformance once per catalog; cache.
2. Branch logic:
   - If any CQL2 URIs → generate CQL2 filter expression.
   - Else if legacy `query` URI → build `query` object.
3. If aggregation URI present → optionally send aggregation request; otherwise skip.
4. Normalize band/platform names internally for downstream spectral operations.
5. Implement tolerant schema handling (missing queryables, differing asset key patterns).

### 7. Recommendations

- Add a lightweight capability abstraction object in your client:
  ```
  {
    "supports_cql2": bool,
    "supports_aggregation": bool,
    "supports_sort": bool,
    "supports_fields": bool
  }
  ```
- Maintain a synonym map for band names across catalogs.
- When targeting performance analytics:
  - PC → use GeoParquet export.
  - AWS → attempt aggregation endpoint first (if you need counts/stats); otherwise perform client-side reduction.

### 8. Follow-Up Options

I can next (just ask):
- Produce a reusable Python helper that auto-detects features and builds the best search payload.
- Draft a band name translation table as a JSON artifact.
- Attempt an aggregation request example against AWS (with graceful failure capture).

Let me know which of those (or something else) you’d like to see next.
