STATSGO2 is a general soil map that has soils data for all of the United States and island territories, but the data is not as detailed as the SSURGO data. The Raster Soil Surveys (RSSs) are the next generation soil survey databases developed using advanced digital soil mapping methods.\n\nThe gNATSGO database is composed primarily of SSURGO data, but STATSGO2 data was used to fill in the gaps.

The operational GOES-R Satellites, GOES-16, GOES-17, and GOES-18, capture 16-band imagery from geostationary orbits over the Western Hemisphere via the Advance Baseline Imager (ABI) radiometer. The ABI captures 2 visible, 4 near-infrared, and 10 infrared channels at resolutions between 0.5km and 2km.\n\n### Geographic coverage\n\nThe ABI captures three levels of coverage, each at a different temporal cadence depending on the modes described below.

The Sentinel-1 Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) data in this collection is a radiometrically terrain corrected product derived from the [Ground Range Detected (GRD) Level-1](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/sentinel-1-grd) products produced by the European Space Agency. The RTC processing is performed by [Catalyst](https://catalyst.earth/).\n\nRadiometric Terrain Correction accounts for terrain variations that affect both the position of a given point on the Earth's surface and the brightness of the radar return, as expressed in radar geometry. Without treatment, the hill-slope modulations of the radiometry threaten to overwhelm weaker thematic land cover-induced backscatter differences. Additionally, comparison of backscatter from multiple satellites, modes, or tracks loses meaning.\n\nA Planetary Computer account is required to retrieve SAS tokens to read the RTC data. See the [documentation](http://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/concepts/sas/#when-an-account-is-needed) for more information.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThe Sentinel-1 GRD product is converted to calibrated intensity using the conversion algorithm described in the ESA technical note ESA-EOPG-CSCOP-TN-0002, [Radiometric Calibration of S-1 Level-1 Products Generated by the S-1 IPF](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/pdfs/sentinel-1/S1-Radiometric-Calibration-V1.0.pdf). The flat earth calibration values for gamma correction (i.e. perpendicular to the radar line of sight) are extracted from the GRD metadata. The calibration coefficients are applied as a two-dimensional correction in range (by sample number) and azimuth (by time). All available polarizations are calibrated and written as separate layers of a single file. The calibrated SAR output is reprojected to nominal map orientation with north at the top and west to the left.\n\nThe data is then radiometrically terrain corrected using PlanetDEM as the elevation source. The correction algorithm is nominally based upon D. Small, [\u201cFlattening Gamma: Radiometric Terrain Correction for SAR Imagery\u201d](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/pdfs/sentinel-1/2011_Flattening_Gamma.pdf), IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Vol 49, No 8., August 2011, pp 3081-3093. For each image scan line, the digital elevation model is interpolated to determine the elevation corresponding to the position associated with the known near slant range distance and arc length for each input pixel. The elevations at the four corners of each pixel are estimated using bilinear resampling. The four elevations are divided into two triangular facets and reprojected onto the plane perpendicular to the radar line of sight to provide an estimate of the area illuminated by the radar for each earth flattened pixel. The uncalibrated sum at each earth flattened pixel is normalized by dividing by the flat earth surface area. The adjustment for gamma intensity is given by dividing the normalized result by the cosine of the incident angle. Pixels which are not illuminated by the radar due to the viewing geometry are flagged as shadow.\n\nCalibrated data is then orthorectified to the appropriate UTM projection. The orthorectified output maintains the original sample sizes (in range and azimuth) and was not shifted to any specific grid.\n\nRTC data is processed only for the Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode, which is the main acquisition mode over land and satisfies the majority of service requirements.\n","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2014-10-10T00:28:21Z",null]]}},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","providers":[{"name":"Catalyst","roles":["processor"],"url":"https://catalyst.earth"},{"name":"Microsoft","roles":["host","licensor"],"url":"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com"}]},{"id":"3dep-lidar-intensity","title":"USGS 3DEP Lidar Intensity","description":"This collection is derived from the [USGS 3DEP COPC collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/3dep-lidar-copc).

## Sentinel-2 (sentinel-2-l2a) STAC Collection Verification ✅

Below is a structured compliance review of the Sentinel‑2 Level‑2A STAC Collection from the Microsoft Planetary Computer against the STAC 1.0.0 Collection specification and relevant common extensions (EO, View, Sat, Item Assets, Projection where applicable).

### 1. API & Service-Level Conformance (Context)
The root and conformance endpoints report support for:
- STAC API Core, Collections, Item Search (query, fields, sort, CQL2 text/json, filter)
- OGC API Features (core, geojson, OpenAPI)
This establishes the service as a STAC API conforming implementation suitable for standard client interaction.

### 2. Collection Identity & Core Required Fields (Spec: STAC Collection 1.0.0)
Required fields present:
- id: sentinel-2-l2a
- type: (implicit via endpoint; collection document returned with expected structure)
- description: Provided (succinct dataset overview)
- license: proprietary (allowed SPDX or custom string; “proprietary” is acceptable though a more specific SPDX identifier isn’t provided—this matches Planetary Computer practice for redistributed ESA-derived value-added products)
- extent:
  - spatial.bbox: [[-180,-90,180,90]] (global coverage)
  - temporal.interval: [["2015-06-27T10:25:31Z", null]] (open-ended ongoing acquisition)
- links: (inherited via API context; not shown embedded in the snippet, but service normally supplies them—acceptable in API context)

Optional but strongly recommended fields present:
- title: “Sentinel-2 Level-2A”
- providers: ESA (producer/licensor), Esri (processor), Microsoft (host/processor) with roles array (conforms to provider role semantics)

Assessment: Core Collection object satisfies mandatory STAC fields.

### 3. Summaries Section (Spec: Collection summaries)
Present and well-structured:
- gsd: [10,20,60] (array of resolutions expected for Sentinel‑2)
- eo:bands: Full list (13 reflective bands + AOT + metadata-like entries) including:
  - name
  - common_name (for standard bands where applicable)
  - gsd per band
  - center_wavelength and full_width_half_max (spectral metadata)
This aligns with EO extension expectations.

- platform: ["Sentinel-2A","Sentinel-2B"]
- instruments: ["msi"]
- constellation: ["sentinel-2"]
- view:off_nadir: [0] (Indicates near-nadir acquisitions; consistent with S2 standard or approximate)
All appropriate for summarizing query ranges and consistent with existing community catalogs.

### 4. Extensions & Cross-Extension Compliance
Implicit use of extensions via summaries and queryables:

| Extension | Evidence | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| EO | eo:bands metadata | Complete spectral definitions present. |
| View | view:off_nadir summary | Minimal; more per-item view metadata (e.g., sun azimuth/elevation) appears in items normally. |
| Sat | Queryables include sat:orbit_state, sat:relative_orbit | Conforms to Sat extension’s defined fields. |
| Projection (proj) | Queryables allow proj:epsg | Items likely include proj:* where relevant per-tile (Sentinel-2 is UTM per granule). |
| Item Assets | Collection-level assets include “thumbnail” and “geoparquet-items” with roles arrays | Matches item-assets extension pattern. |
| Table / Parquet | geoparquet-items asset includes table:storage_options and msft:partition_info (custom vendor fields). |

All fields use recognized naming patterns; unknown vendor-specific keys (`msft:*`) allowed per spec (namespaced).

### 5. Assets Section (Collection-Level)
Assets present:
- thumbnail: proper roles ["thumbnail"], type image/png
- geoparquet-items: application/x-parquet, roles ["stac-items"], description of exported items snapshot, partition metadata. This is a value-added convenience asset; conforms to informal patterns used in PC catalogs.

No issues; asset objects contain required href & type, plus optional descriptive metadata.

### 6. Queryables Inspection (CQL2 / Filter Support)
Returned queryables for collection `sentinel-2-l2a` include:
- Core temporal/identity: id, datetime, start_datetime, end_datetime
- Geometry
- Platform-specific / domain-specific: s2:* (granule id, datatake id, tile, quality percentages), eo:cloud_cover
- Orbital: sat:orbit_state, sat:relative_orbit
- Processing: s2:processing_baseline, s2:product_type (enum S2MSI2A)
- Quality / classification percentages (vegetation, water, cloud shadow, etc.)
- Spectral/illumination: mean solar zenith/azimuth
- proj:epsg
Validation: Fields align with widely adopted Sentinel-2 item property conventions (consistent with Earth Search / Element84 and PC patterns). Enumerations provided where appropriate (product_type, datatake_type, orbit_state). Numeric constraints (0–100) on percentage fields consistent with spec expectations and aids client-side validation.

### 7. Completeness vs. STAC Collection Spec
Typical optional fields not shown (and not strictly required):
- keywords
- version
- deprecated (not needed)
- item_assets (some catalogs include structured item_assets at collection root; here, band definitions appear in summaries instead—acceptable)
- schemas/links in the collection snippet (likely present in full API response)
Absence of these is not a compliance failure.

### 8. Semantic Accuracy/Domain Checks
- Band central wavelengths & FWHMs match Sentinel-2 MSI published specs (e.g., B02 ~0.49 μm, B08 ~0.842 μm, SWIR bands correct).
- GSD assignments correct (10m: B02, B03, B04, B08; 20m: B05, B06, B07, B8A, B11, B12; 60m: B01, B09, AOT)
- Platforms list both A & B (mission constellation complete since 2017)
- Temporal start (2015-06-27) aligns with early Sentinel-2A acquisitions pre-global coverage (slight lead-in before full L2A availability; acceptable due to retrospective processing).

### 9. License Considerations
“proprietary” is used. Planetary Computer commonly applies “proprietary” where redistribution terms require gating/value-added conditions. While STAC encourages SPDX identifiers, this usage is consistent across PC datasets. If stricter SPDX alignment desired, could consider clarifying license via link or using a custom license link in `links` array—but not a spec violation.

### 10. Potential Minor Enhancements (Non-blocking)
- Add `keywords` to improve discoverability (e.g., ["Sentinel-2","MSI","EO","optical","L2A","bottom-of-atmosphere"])
- Provide explicit `stac_version` at collection root (often inherited via API, but explicit field aids standalone portability)
- Include `item_assets` extension block enumerating canonical asset keys (e.g., B02, B03, metadata, thumbnail) for stronger client contract. Many catalogs rely on per-item assets only; optional.

### 11. Compliance Verdict
Status: The Sentinel-2 L2A Collection as retrieved is compliant with STAC 1.0.0 Collection requirements and correctly leverages EO, Sat, View, and related extension field conventions. No blocking issues found. Catalog structure supports advanced filtering (queryables + CQL2 + filter conformance). Metadata richness is high and consistent with community practice.

### 12. Summary Table

| Aspect | Result | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Core required fields | Pass | All mandatory fields present |
| Extent (spatial/temporal) | Pass | Global bbox + open-ended temporal |
| License | Pass | Uses “proprietary” (consistent with PC style) |
| Providers | Pass | Roles correctly assigned |
| Summaries (eo:bands etc.) | Pass | Complete spectral metadata |
| Extensions usage | Pass | EO, Sat, View, Projection (per items), Item Asset patterns |
| Queryables | Pass | Rich set with proper typing/enums |
| Collection assets | Pass | Thumbnail + GeoParquet item snapshot |
| Conformance (service-level) | Pass | STAC API + OGC Features + CQL2 |
| Optional enhancements | N/A | Could add keywords, item_assets schema, explicit stac_version |

### 13. Conclusion
The sentinel-2-l2a collection conforms to the STAC 1.0.0 specification and expected extension semantics. It is suitable for robust programmatic discovery, filtering, and downstream analysis. Only optional refinements (keywords, explicit item_assets, explicit stac_version) could be considered for incremental UX improvements; none are required for compliance.

Let me know if you’d like:
- A comparison against another provider’s Sentinel-2 catalog
- A sample CQL2 filter query
- Validation of an individual Item document for deeper per-item compliance

Happy to dive further.

BnJam: what aggregations are there?

GitHub Copilot: Querying the STAC API aggregations endpoint for Sentinel-2 to enumerate available aggregation outputs. 

Ran `get_aggregations` 
Completed with input: {
  "catalog_url": "https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1",
  "collections": [
    "sentinel-2-l2a"
  ],
  "limit": 0,
  "output_format": "json"
}

<details>

```json
{"mode":"json","data":{"type":"aggregations","supported":false,"aggregations":{},"message":"No aggregations returned","parameters":{"collections":["sentinel-2-l2a"],"aggregations":{"count":{"type":"count"}}}}}
```

</details>

The API response indicates that aggregations aren’t supported (or not enabled) for this catalog/query:

Key details:
- supported: false
- aggregations: {} (empty)
- message: "No aggregations returned"
- The client attempted a default count aggregation, but the server didn’t execute it.

Interpretation:
The Planetary Computer STAC API root advertises Item Search conformance but (for this dataset/query) does not expose the STAC Aggregations (experimental/extension) capability. Some STAC APIs (e.g., Earth Search v1) expose an extensions list including an aggregations endpoint (like /search with "aggregations" object in the response) if implemented. Here, the server returned an explicit unsupported signal.

What you can do instead:
1. Client-side aggregation: Issue a paginated Item Search and compute counts/statistics locally (e.g., counts per MGRS tile, date histograms, cloud cover stats).
2. Use CQL2 filters to narrow subsets (e.g., by date range, cloud cover) and still perform client-side summarization.
3. Check another catalog (e.g., AWS Earth Search) which may implement the aggregations extension if server-side counts/histograms are required.

If you want, I can:
- Draft example code to perform client-side aggregations for Sentinel-2 (e.g., item count by month, average cloud cover).
- Probe another collection to confirm whether any collection on this API supports aggregations.
- Show a sample CQL2 query pattern for narrowing searches prior to local aggregation.

Let me know which follow-up you’d like.
